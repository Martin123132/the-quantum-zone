MBT Quantum Spin Liquid Model
1. Lattice & Variables

We consider a lattice 𝓛 of N spin sites indexed by i. Each site has:
- Spin orientation: Sᵢ ∈ ℝ³ (unit vector, |Sᵢ| = 1).
- Observation entanglement field: ψᵢⱼ ∈ [0,1] between sites i and j.
- Coherence collapse: Cᵢⱼ ∈ [0,1], representing local entropy or memory loss.
- Sheet curvature: κ ∈ ℝ, representing MBT spacetime tension.

2. Hamiltonian

We define the MBT Hamiltonian:

Hₘᵦₜ = J Σ⟨i,j⟩ (Sᵢ · Sⱼ)(1 - Cᵢⱼ) + λ Σᵢⱼ ψᵢⱼ Sᵢ · Sⱼ + μ κ²

Where:
- J is the nearest-neighbor exchange constant.
- λ controls long-range MBT observation entanglement.
- μ controls curvature tension energy.

3. Order Parameters

1. Classical Spin Correlation:
    M = (1/N) Σᵢⱼ Sᵢ · Sⱼ

2. MBT Entanglement Memory:
    Ψ = (1/N) Σᵢⱼ ψᵢⱼ

3. Curvature Energy:
    K = μ κ²

Quantum Spin Liquid Criterion (MBT):
    M → 0 and Ψ > 0

4. Memory Persistence Law Link

We integrate MBT’s memory persistence:

M(x,t) = (1 - C(x,t)) [ P(x,t) + γ ∂²T(x,t)/∂x² ]

Here, P represents local spin presence intensity and T captures transmissibility of entanglement echoes.

In spin lattice form:
    Ψ ∼ M = (1 - C) P cₑₒcₕₒ²

This ensures QSL long-range order is memory-driven rather than magnetically ordered.

5. Takeaway

- MBT treats QSL phases as high-memory / low-classical-order states.
- Long-range entanglement is a result of observation connectivity (ψ) and sheet curvature (κ).
- Coherence collapse (C) dynamically competes, driving quantum disordered but memory-persistent phases.
