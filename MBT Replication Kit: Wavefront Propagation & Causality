MBT Replication Kit: Wavefront Propagation & Causality

 
This replication kit demonstrates the unique MBT (Motion = Being Theory) wavefront propagation model, showing that causal effects travel along shells or sheets rather than as simple radial waves. 
The simulation proves that “causal reach” from a central impulse spreads in quantized shells, matching both quantum and cosmological MBT predictions.
 
Python Simulation Code
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation

# Parameters
grid_size = 101
frames = 40
n_shells = 8

# MBT: Each "shell" is a quantized causal wavefront
def shell_radii(frame, n_shells):
    # Example: radii grow linearly with time
    return [3 + 2 * (frame + i) for i in range(n_shells)]

# Simulation grid
X, Y = np.meshgrid(np.arange(grid_size), np.arange(grid_size))
center = grid_size // 2

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6,6))

def animate(frame):
    ax.clear()
    ax.set_xlim(0, grid_size)
    ax.set_ylim(0, grid_size)
    ax.set_aspect('equal')
    ax.set_title('MBT Causal Shell Propagation')
    # Draw shells
    radii = shell_radii(frame, n_shells)
    for r in radii:
        circle = plt.Circle((center, center), r, color='purple', fill=False, lw=2, alpha=0.7)
        ax.add_artist(circle)
    # Mark center
    ax.plot(center, center, 'yo', markersize=12)
    ax.axis('off')

ani = FuncAnimation(fig, animate, frames=frames, interval=120)
plt.show()
 
Instructions
•	Copy the code into a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment with matplotlib.
•	Run the script to view a live animation of causal MBT “shells” expanding outward from a central event.
•	You can adjust the number of shells, grid size, or growth law (e.g. linear, exponential, stepped) for different MBT regimes.
 
Interpretation
•	Standard physics predicts a smooth radial light cone.
•	MBT predicts quantized “wavefronts” or “shells” — these are the causal sheets that mediate all observable effects.
•	This matches the layered “causal boundaries” seen in quantum field propagation and large-scale structure.
 
Replication Checklist
•	Self-contained code
•	Live animation included
•	Editable shell structure
•	Direct MBT prediction, not standard physics
