Material Sourcing & Handling for MBT Particle Forge

1. Strategic Sourcing of Seed Materials

Goal:
Ensure reliable, high-purity starting materials for quantum chip experiments—both for immediate proof-of-concept (graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, silicon) and for more ambitious MBT particle synthesis.

A. Immediate-Use Materials
•	Graphene:
o	Vendors: Graphenea, ACS Materials, 2D Semiconductors
o	Form: Monolayer films on copper/nickel foil or Si/SiO₂ wafers
o	Purity: ≥99.99%, minimal grain boundaries/defects
•	TMDs (MoS₂, WS₂, etc.):
o	Vendors: HQ Graphene, 2D Semiconductors
o	Form: Mechanical exfoliation crystals or CVD-grown films
o	Purity: ≥99.99%
•	Silicon (for benchmarking):
o	Vendors: University wafer suppliers (e.g., UniversityWafer, SiQuest)
o	Form: 4” or 6” Si wafers, orientation ⟨100⟩ or ⟨111⟩, test-grade

B. Photonic Materials (For Light/Matter Conversion)
•	Laser Source:
o	Vendors: Thorlabs, Edmund Optics, Newport
o	Type: Femtosecond/pulsed or continuous-wave, wavelength tunable
•	Mirror & Cavity Coatings:
o	Vendors: CVI Laser Optics, Edmund Optics
o	Spec: Dielectric or metallic, >99.5% reflectivity, vacuum compatible

2. Handling and Storage
•	Storage:
o	Store all 2D materials and sensitive substrates in nitrogen or argon glove boxes if available; otherwise, vacuum-sealed containers.
o	Avoid direct handling—use tweezers with anti-static coating and clean-room gloves.
o	Keep materials out of direct sunlight, moisture, and dust at all times.
•	Contamination Control:
o	Dedicate workspace and tools to prevent cross-contamination.
o	Regularly clean vacuum chambers with isopropyl alcohol and bake out to minimise outgassing.
o	For laser systems, use dust-free wipes and regularly inspect optics for debris.

3. Documentation & Supply Chain Traceability
•	Record batch numbers and supplier information for every material used.
•	Keep certificates of analysis for all seed materials to ensure traceability for publication or patenting.
 
Summary Statement:

Robust material sourcing and contamination control are foundational to reproducibility and device performance. The MBT approach is “open-source ready”—all vendors listed are internationally available, and handling protocols are compatible with university, startup, or major industry lab standards. This transparency accelerates both replication and scaling.
